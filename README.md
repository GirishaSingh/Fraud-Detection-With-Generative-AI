# Fraud-Detection-With-Generative-AI
Enhancing fraud detection mechanisms using generative AI.

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a comprehensive fraud detection system for digital payments using generative AI techniques. The project addresses key challenges in fraud detection, including data quality, anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and user privacy.

## Problem Statement
With the increasing volume and complexity of transactions, digital payment companies face significant challenges in accurately detecting and preventing fraudulent activities. The goal is to enhance current fraud detection mechanisms using generative AI to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time, adapting quickly to emerging fraud patterns while minimizing false positives.

## Objectives
1. Improve Data Quality and Diversity
2. Enhance Anomaly Detection and Pattern Recognition
3. Maintain User Privacy and Data Security

## Solution Overview
### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Improve data quality and diversity using GANs for synthetic data generation.
- Address potential gaps or biases in the data.

### Anomaly Detection and Pattern Recognition
- Implement advanced techniques:
  - GANs for generating synthetic fraud data.
  - Autoencoders for real-time anomaly detection.
  - LSTMs for capturing temporal patterns.
- Use reinforcement learning for adaptive model improvement.

### User Privacy and Data Security
- Apply data anonymization techniques.
- Ensure compliance with regulations (GDPR, CCPA).
- Use federated learning for privacy-preserving machine learning.

## Implementation

### Data Preprocessing
- Scripts and notebooks for data cleaning, transformation, and synthetic data generation.

### Anomaly Detection
- Code for training and evaluating GANs and autoencoders.

### Pattern Recognition
- LSTM models for detecting temporal fraud patterns.

### Privacy and Security
- Techniques for data anonymization and federated learning.

## Expected Outcomes
- Enhanced fraud detection accuracy.
- Reduced false positives, improving user experience.
- Robust data privacy and security, boosting user trust.
